# atmega-playgound
my personal playground for custom smart home implementation, using microcontroller of the AtMega and AtTiny series.

First prototyp state was a simple blinking of the light arc (without FUVM usage).

I may upload videos some day.

#### _on 2017-08-05:_

software can target a 7 segment output, can read distance from ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

**Goal is:**
* writing a lite framework for Atmel CPUs for home automation purpose which comes with:
* * a cooperative scheduler
* * simple user interface tools
* * some tools for distance sensor
* * a tool for blinking of a candle arch (Schwibbogen)
* * some easy network tools for communicating with other atmels and raspberry pi for information interchange
